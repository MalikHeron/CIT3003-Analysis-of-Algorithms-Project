# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

In this project, I implement a search algorithm that finds the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. This project is inspired by [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) game.

# The Code in Action

In this section, we can see the end result of implementation by looking at how many degrees of separation these actors are from each other.

## Mandy Patinkin & Gerald R. Molen
