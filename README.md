# Six Degrees of Separation

In this project, we are required to implement an algorithm that finds the degrees of separation between two persons and recommend to each personâ€™s close contact, all the activities that the person is engaged in.

This project is based on implementations from https://github.com/priyanktejani/degrees and https://github.com/alireza-mahmoodi/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon.git

# The Code in Action

In this section, we can see the end result of implementation by looking at how many degrees of separation these actors are from each other.
